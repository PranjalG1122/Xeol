# Back End

This project was built with a simplistic backend stack, including:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/)

Xeol's server was hosted on Vercel. This was done to simplify the deployment
process, as Vercel has a simple and easy to use deployment process. Vercel's
Blob storage was also used to store user avatars.

Sendgrid was used to send emails to users when they sign up and log in. It was
used because it was free and easy to use.
